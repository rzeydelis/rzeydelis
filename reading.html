        <h2>How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            While the title might sound sleezy (sorry for the lack of a better word), this book is truly amazing. It really helps you
            change the way you behave (in a good way, not a sleezy way). By understanding human rationale, you can getpeopleto appreciate you much more.
            Hands-down one of my favorite books ever because of how much I have learned from it.

        <h2>Zero to One by Peter Thiel with Blake Masters</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Peter Thiel is one of the greatest tech investors of today. He co-founded Paypal and was an early investor in Facebook.
            Peter Thiel explains the importance of innovating rather than copying business models and how to take your start-up from 0 to 1.
            This book has truly changed the way I think about business and how to bring value to society.

        <h2>Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Great book for those trying to understand and start investing. Also provides a lot of life philosophies that I follow today.
            Benajmin Graham was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia University.

        <h2>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Benjamin Franklin was a great entrepreneur, inventor, diplomat and philanthropist during his time. One of
            the most interesting people to ever exist, I highly recommend this book to any aspiring entrepreneurs. Even
            if you are not an aspiring entrepreneur, this book is definitely worth a read.

        <h2>Predictive Analytics: Who will click, buy, lie or die by Eric Siegel</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Great introduction to Predictive Analytics without all the math and stats. If you have been hearing
