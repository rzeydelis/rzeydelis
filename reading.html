        <h2>Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham</h2>

        <h2>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life by Walter Isaacson</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Benjamin Franklin was a great entrepreneur, inventor, diplomat and philanthropist during his time. One of
            the most interesting people to ever exist, I highly recommend this book to any aspiring entrepreneurs. Even
            if you are not an aspiring entrepreneur, this book is definitely worth a read.
