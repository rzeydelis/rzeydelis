    <!-- INDIA -->
        <h1 class="headers">My Life Travels</h1>
        <h2> India</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Oh man, India. Where do I begin? I spent 6 months in India and it has definitely changed my life 
        just like everyone said it would, but not in the way that I thought it would. India has opened my eyes for the
        first time as I saw society from a completely different viewpoint. If I ever write an autobiography, India is
        going to get its own chapter.For those of you who have never been, I recommend going, but it is definitely not for everyone.
        If you are adventurous and don't mind feeling uncomfortable, then go. 
        </p>


        <p class = "paragraph"> 
            Unlike the United States, India can be very unorganized and chaotic. This is why I
        respect all the Indians who are trying to progress India. When you have 1.3 billion people,
        ~40 different languages (not dialects) and a subpar infrastructure, that shit ain't easy. United States problems
        are easy. If we have a problem in the US, we just throw some money at it and it gets fixed with usually no issues.
        With a 3rd of the land and 4 times the population compared to the US, any Indian who tries to solve the problems of
        India gets my respect 100%. Dhiraj Rajaram once said that "It's easy to decide to come to the United States. 
        It is hard to decide to go back to India." This was in respect to India people who went to the United States to work and even sometimes
        immigrated. Anyways, the point I am trying to make is that if you go to India you will see some things that
        are amazing in their own way and meet some of the greatest people.

        <!--- Bangalore -->
        <h3> Bangalore/Bengaluru </h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> 
            For most of my time in India, I was in Bangalore because that was where I worked.
        Bangalore is known as the Silicon Valley of India because of the large amount of tech companies and young
        people. Bangalore is modernizing very quickly. When I first arrived there, I used to walk on a dirt path
        to work. By the time, I left I was walking on a paved sidewalk. Bangalore is full of technology parks.
        Technology parks are special economic zones for companies to setup shop. You will find almost every 
        Fortune 100 company in Bangalore. Apple, Dell, Walmart, Goldman Sachs, you name it. Bangalore has amazing
        restaurants and gigantic malls. There are so many people in Bangalore, that they even have 2 malls across
        the street from each other. From micro-breweries to clubbing to dining, Bangalore has it all. For those of
        you non-city folks, be careful crossing the street and be prepared to feel uncomfortable as it is a city with
        12 million people. Manhattan people - have no fear, just keep doing what you always do when crossing the street
        (don't look).

        <!--- Kodaikanal -->
        <h3> Kodaikanal </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Kodaikanal is a hill station in the souther Indian state of Tamil Nadu. If you are looking
            for a place with amazing views, come to Kodaikanal. Because of its hills, steppe farming is big and really cool.
            We rented an airbnb on top of the hills with a beautiful view and where the clouds were constantly passing through us.
            Our hosts were very generous and would cook us breakfast, lunch and dinner, but there are some amazing South Indian style
            restaurants where you eat on a banana leaf as a plate. There are a lot of hidden sites. We would go off-track 
            find some hidden waterfalls and paths. We had youngsters show us their favorite hidden places because you know
            little kids are always wandering and exploring. 
        </p>
            <i>The view from our airbnb with the clouds passing by. You can also see the steppe farming that is popular in Kodaikanal.</i>

        <!--- Pondicherry -->
        <h3> Pondicherry </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Pondicherry was a French colonial settlement until 1945 and you can see it through the architecture
            and culture of the area. Be prepared to take a lot of photos for their locals because they all happen to have homework assignment to take pictures with foreigners. Pondicherry has a few nice beaches with some really classy french-style restaurants. 
        </p>
        
        <!--- Goa -->
        <h3> Goa </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Goa - the state of endless partying. What was once Portguese territory until 1961, is now a hotspot
            for Indians and foreigns (particulary Britons and Russians). Goa has a very hippy vibe to it, but its
            amazing beaches, grat nightclubs and a trance music haven - it is truly a must for anyone looking to
            have a beach vacation without breaking the bank. I recommend renting a scooter as soon as you get off the bus because it is the cheapest and funnest way to get around. Also Google maps somehow works even on dirt roads, so you will never get lost. I stayed at the Paradise Guest House, which is a low-key 
            hostel. The rooms are good, they have dogs and cats walking around and even roosters to wake you up
            in the morning (this is probably a turn-off for a lot of you). My friends stayed at a hostel called
            Prison by thehostelcrowd, which was a really cool one if you are looking for a traditional-style hostel. You can find these hostels on hostelworld.com.
